# Why did i make this ?

Because nobody has bothered to make a phantomjs or selenium portable and easy soloution for windows they are all requiring you to setup python and pip and have way to many dependencies this has NONE!

It is also useful for automating web based tasked on windows for example with Sonarr or Radarr even just opening facebook and clicking like on the latest post from a friend.

# How do i find XPath to use inside the script ?

Open developer tools in your browser normally

#### Keyboard: `Ctrl + Shift + I`
#### Internet Explorer and Edge: `F12`
#### macOS: `⌘ + ⌥ + I`

The right click a element you want to click modify alter output use what not and `COPY` then `XPath` Thats it!


# Requirments NONE!

NONE! YES NONE! YOU DO NOT NEED TO ANYTHING JUST RUN THE `.cmd` batch file script and enjoy.
